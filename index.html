        <div>To tell you a little about me my name is Demarcus Lester. I am 23 years old and live in Memphis, TN. I was born and raised here so I'm very familar with the city and culture. I graduated highschool in 2016 and went to UT Knoxville the same year. I came home in late 2017 and have been working on the security indstry for two plus years now. I have decided early 2021 to pursue programming through this program with CodeCrew and am excited for the journey!
